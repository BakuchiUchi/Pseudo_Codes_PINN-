# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate physical laws directly into the training 
# process of neural networks to solve problems in fluid dynamics and other physics-based domains. 
# By embedding governing equations such as the Euler equations into the neural network's loss function, 
# the model is trained to predict physical quantities like density, velocity, and pressure, while ensuring 
# the predictions obey the underlying physical laws. This approach allows PINNs to tackle both forward 
# problems, where all initial and boundary conditions are known, and inverse problems, where only partial 
# or sparse data is available, making them a powerful tool for scenarios where traditional numerical methods 
# face limitations, especially in high-speed flow simulations.

# The core working of the PINN model involves training the network using two types of losses: 
# data loss and physics loss. Data loss ensures that the networkâ€™s predictions match known data points 
# (e.g., experimental results or boundary conditions), while the physics loss enforces the conservation 
# laws of mass, momentum, and energy by using automatic differentiation to compute the residuals of the 
# governing equations. This dual loss framework allows the model to handle complex problems, such as those 
# involving shock waves or discontinuities, with a reduced need for large amounts of labeled data, making PINNs 
# particularly effective for inverse problems like inferring hidden states or physical parameters from sparse observations.

# The use of this model is highly relevant in fields like aerospace engineering, automotive design, and 
# environmental science, where fluid dynamics plays a crucial role. For example, PINNs can be used to model 
# high-speed airflows around aircraft or vehicles, predict shock waves, or infer aerodynamic properties from 
# limited experimental data. Additionally, in atmospheric or oceanic flows, where gathering real-time data is 
# difficult, PINNs can be applied to predict missing variables by leveraging known physical laws. This combination 
# of data-driven learning and theory-driven constraints makes PINNs a valuable tool for solving practical, 
# real-world problems across various scientific and engineering disciplines.
