# The model presented here integrates Rough Set Theory (RST) for attribute reduction and a
# Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) to assess software project risks more efficiently. 
# In practice, software project management often involves evaluating numerous risk factors, 
# many of which might be redundant or irrelevant. By applying RST, this model reduces the 
# number of input features from a large set (e.g., 35 risk factors) to a smaller, more informative
# subset (e.g., 12 risk factors). This reduction helps the model focus on the most impactful risk
# factors, improving computational efficiency while maintaining prediction accuracy.

# After identifying the key features, the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) is trained
# to predict the risk level of software projects. The BPNN excels at learning complex relationships
# between inputs and outputs by forward propagating data through hidden layers and adjusting 
# its weights via backpropagation based on prediction errors. Using the reduced dataset allows the
# BPNN to focus on learning critical relationships between the key risk factors and the target output 
# (the risk level). The networkâ€™s multi-layer architecture enhances its ability to capture non-linear 
# patterns, making it effective in predicting risk.

# This hybrid model is especially valuable in real-world scenarios where project failure due to 
# mismanaged risks is a concern. The RST+BPNN model provides a reliable, automated way to assess 
# risks early in the project life cycle, enabling proactive mitigation. By prioritizing the most significant 
# risk factors, organizations can allocate resources more effectively, potentially increasing success rates 
# and reducing costs. The combined use of RST for feature refinement and BPNN for predictive analysis 
# makes the model both efficient and accurate, serving as a useful tool in project risk management.
